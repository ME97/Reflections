What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	To initialize a repository you must first navigate to the 
	directory you wish to create the repository in, and run the 
	command 'git init'. This creates a hidden .git/ folder and allows 
	you to start tracking changes and making commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area only holds files that the user has chosen to
	add, in preperation for a commit. In contrast, the working
	directory/repository hold all of the files involved in the project.
	The staging area allows you to add only what is neccessary to the 
	commit as opposed to comitting every file in the directory.

change?
